My neighbours have taken it a bit too far using my wireless (7
devices? for 4 weeks?). Inspired by upside-down-ternet[1], I wrote this.
:-)

src/proxy is the main proxy library.

src/upsidedown is a proxy which flips every image requested through it.

src/logger simply logs every request.

To create you own proxy, create a proxy.Proxy object with a slice
of request manglers and response manglers.  A mangler is a function
which takes a request/response, modifies it in some way, and returns
the modified request/response.  Look at src/logger or src/upsidedown
for examples.

Exercises for the reader: inject js, replace every flv with a rick roll.
